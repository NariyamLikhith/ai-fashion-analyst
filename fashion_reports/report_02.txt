TITLE: Deloitte Fashion & Luxury Private Equity and Investors Survey 2024

OVERVIEW OF M&A LANDSCAPE: Investor appetite for the fashion and luxury sector remains robust despite macroeconomic volatility. A significant majority of surveyed investors (approximately 75%) intend to pursue new investments within the next 12-18 months. This confidence is fueled by the sector's proven resilience and its ability to generate strong returns. Key drivers for M&A activity include the consolidation of brands under larger luxury groups, the acquisition of digitally native direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands by established players, and investment in enabling technologies that support the industry's digital and sustainable transformation.

KEY INVESTMENT CRITERIA: Digital prowess and sustainability are no longer optional extras but fundamental criteria for investment. Investors are scrutinizing a brand's digital maturity, including the strength of its e-commerce platform, its social commerce strategy, and its ability to leverage data for personalization. A strong DTC channel is seen as a major asset, providing direct access to customers and valuable data. On the sustainability front, investors are conducting deeper due diligence on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. They are looking for brands with transparent supply chains, a clear roadmap for reducing their carbon footprint, and a genuine commitment to ethical practices. Brands that can demonstrate strong performance in these areas are commanding higher valuations.

GROWTH SEGMENTS: The personal luxury goods segment, particularly hard luxury (jewelry and watches) and high-end leather goods, continues to be the most attractive for investors, valued for its high margins and brand loyalty. Beyond this core, the secondhand luxury market is a major area of focus. Investors are actively seeking opportunities to back leading resale platforms, recognizing the consumer shift towards circular fashion. Another significant growth area is 'phygital' retail, where technology is used to enhance the physical store experience. This includes investments in smart mirrors, AR try-on solutions, and clienteling apps that empower sales associates. Geographically, while Europe and North America remain core, there is a growing interest in the potential of markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

CONCLUSION: The fashion and luxury investment landscape is becoming more sophisticated. While brand heritage remains important, investors are placing a much greater emphasis on future-proof capabilities, particularly in digital and sustainability. The most successful investments will be in companies that can blend timeless brand appeal with a modern, agile, and responsible operating model.

TITLE: EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles

STRATEGY GOALS AND VISION: The European Commission has adopted a comprehensive EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles. The vision is that by 2030, textile products placed on the EU market will be long-lived and recyclable, made as much as possible of recycled fibers, free of hazardous substances, and produced in respect of social rights and the environment. The strategy aims to end the era of 'fast fashion' by creating a greener, more competitive, and more resilient textile sector.

KEY PROPOSED MEASURES - ECO-DESIGN REQUIREMENTS: A central pillar of the strategy is the introduction of mandatory ecodesign requirements for textiles under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation. These requirements will set minimum standards for product durability, reusability, repairability, and recycled fiber content. The aim is to ensure that products are designed from the outset to have a longer life and to be easily recycled at the end of their life. This will effectively ban the worst-performing products from the market.

KEY PROPOSED MEASURES - DIGITAL PRODUCT PASSPORT: To empower consumers and improve transparency, the strategy will introduce a Digital Product Passport for textiles. This will provide detailed, standardized information on a product's environmental and circularity characteristics. Consumers will be able to scan a code to access information on aspects such as the materials used, the supply chain, repair options, and end-of-life handling. This will help them make more informed purchasing decisions and combat greenwashing.

KEY PROPOSED MEASURES - TACKLING GREENWASHING AND WASTE: The strategy includes stricter rules on environmental claims made by companies, ensuring they are substantiated and verifiable. Vague terms like 'green' or 'eco-friendly' will be banned unless backed by a recognized eco-label. Furthermore, the strategy will introduce mandatory and harmonized Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes for textiles in all EU Member States. Under these schemes, producers will be financially responsible for the collection, sorting, and recycling of textile waste, creating a strong incentive to design more circular products.
